8840825	The answer is c. Potassium salts are almost always water soluable and so are most nitrates. Chlorides are also highly soluable, and many copper compounds are water soluable. The best exception to the chloride soluability rule is silver chloride. Sulfides are mostly non-soluable and the same is true of phosphates. However, potassium and sodium sulfides and phosphates are soluable. Phosphoric acid and hydrogen sulfide are also soluable.

8840833	In 1947, dogs were officially outlawed in China, but some Shar-Pei's were exported to the United States from Hong Kong in 1970 and to Europe in 1980. One of the most unusual breeds in existence, the Shar-Pei is much sought after by fanciers who love its eclectic appearance. A miniature Pei (weighing 15 kg and measuring approximately 35 cm at the withers) also exists, but is not recognized by the FCI.

8840836	Weight: Approx. 20 kg (44 lb). History. This ancient Chinese breed has endured for centuries and still lives in provinces bordering the China Sea to the south. The Shar-Pei has been used as temple guard, fighting dog, hunting dog (boar), and herd guard.
8840837	The exact origin of the Chow Chow is unknown, but we do know that it is a very old breed. The oldest known dog fossils, dated back to several million years ago, are very similar in structure to the Chow Chow. Pictures on Chinese pottery which looked like the Chow Chow date back as far back as 206 BC.

8840845	Placement on involuntary leave of absence is not disciplinary, and a student who wishes to take a voluntary leave of absence rather than being placed on involuntary leave of absence will ordinarily be allowed to do so.
8840846	However, if the employee leaves work on the effective date of discharge but prior to the end of the normal workday, there is a discharge rather than a voluntary leaving, even if the employee is paid for that day's work .
8840847	Similar to a Voluntary Leave Transfer. Bank, the leave used from the Emergency Leave Transfer Bank affects recipients differently and puts. different limits on the donations that a person can make to the program. â¢ Voluntary Leave transfer banks will allow employees to donate leave to a pool for use by anyone.

8840849	Beginning in 2016, the monthly maximum tax exclusion for transit or parking benefits will each be $255, subject to an annual inflation adjustment. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act on Dec. 17.
8840850	The IRS has announced the inflation adjusted 2016 limits for health FSAs in a 125 cafeteria plan and the Parking and Transit limits in a 132 Transportation Plan. Under Revenue Procedure 2015-53 the IRS announced that the 2016 health FSA pre-tax plan year deduction limit will remain $2,550, the same as 2015. For Transportation Plans, the 2016 Parking limit, effective for January, is adjusted to $255 per month from $250. The 2016 Transit Benefit, including Van Pooling, remains $130 per month. The health FSA pre-tax deduction limit is per employee, per employer per plan year. And, if the employer contributes to the health FSA, the employerâs contribution is in addition to the amount that the employee can elect. Therefore, the employee can elect up to the maximum and still receive the employerâs contribution.
8840851	In 2015, the maximum monthly tax-exclusion for money that employers spent on public-transit passes and vanpool benefits for employees fell from $250 to $130, while the exclusion for qualified parking benefits remained at $250.

8840883	LTS is an abbreviation for âLong Term Supportâ. We produce a new Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server release every six months [diagram below]. That means you'll always have the latest and greatest applications that the open source world has to offer. Ubuntu is designed with security in mind. You get free security updates for at least 9 months on the desktop and server. A new LTS version is released every 2 years. In previous releases, a Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, both versions will receive 5 years support.
8840884	LTS is Laugh To Self - A variant for LOL (Laughing Out Loud) A portrayal of good humor - before reaching the LOL stage. People often type LOL when they aren't really LOL. 11 year old Kristen Tobey from Fort Wayne, IN noticed this and started encouraging friends to type LTS for gathering humor, which caught on. This opens the door for more shortcut terms in degrees of chuckle.
8840885	The term long-term-support is usually reserved for special versions or editions of software that otherwise has a much shorter release life cycle. Typically, a publisher of LTS software maintains it for at least two years. 1 Need for long-term support.
8840886	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Long-term support (LTS) is a type of special versions or editions of software designed to be supported for a longer than normal period. It is particularly applicable to open-source software and projects.
8840887	New even-numbered versions (e.g. v6, v8, v10, etc) are cut in April. New odd-numbered versions (e.g. v5, v7, v9) are cut in October. When a new odd-numbered major release is cut, the previous even-numbered major version transitions to the Long Term Support plan. Every major version covered by the LTS plan will be actively maintained for a period of 18 months from the date it enters LTS coverage. Following those 18 months of active support, the major version will transition into maintenance mode for 12 additional months.

8840890	A/B testing is the act of running a simultaneous experiment between two or more pages to see which performs or converts the best. Despite the name (A/B testing), the experiment can be conducted with as many pages as desired. Once you have decided what to test on your landing page (e.g. headline, call to action, photography, adding a video etc.) â you can create new versions (or variants) of your page to enter into the experiment.
8840891	In order to achieve that goal, the team would try A/B testing changes to the headline, visual imagery, form fields, call to action, and overall layout of the page. Testing one change at a time helps them pinpoint which changes had an effect on their visitorsâ behavior, and which ones did not.
8840892	Assigning traffic weight in an A/B test. Traffic is randomly assigned to each page variant based upon a predetermined weighting â for example, if you are running a test with 2 page variants, you might split the traffic 50/50 or 60/40.
8840893	Definition - What does A/B Test mean? An A/B test is an online marketing tactic where different versions of a product are used to see which one users or consumers prefer. With online products, such as a webpage, email campaign or advertisement, A/B testing can be carried out with relative ease and yield quick results due to the instant and detailed analytics that testers receive. A/B testing is also known as split testing or bucket testing.
8840894	A/B testing (sometimes called split testing) is comparing two versions of a web page to see which one performs better. You compare two web pages by showing the two variants (let's call them A and B) to similar visitors at the same time. The one that gives a better conversion rate, wins!
8840895	A/B Testing. Definition. A marketing experiment where two variations of a landing page, ad, email or other piece of online content are pitted against each other to determine which produces the highest conversion rate. A/B testing is the key to optimizing your marketing campaign.
8840896	A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.
8840897	Why You Should A/B Test. A/B testing allows individuals, teams, and companies to make careful changes to their user experiences while collecting data on the results. This allows them to construct hypotheses, and to learn better why certain elements of their experiences impact user behavior.
8840898	In marketing and business intelligence, A/B testing is a term for a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B, which are the control and variation in the controlled experiment.
8840899	A/B testing allows you to make more out of your existing traffic. While the cost of acquiring paid traffic can be huge, the cost of increasing your conversions is minimal. To compare, a Small Business Plan of Visual Website Optimizer starts at $49. That's the cost of 5 to 10 Google Adwords clicks.
8840900	Orthoclase, or orthoclase feldspar (endmember formula K Al Si 3 O 8), is an important tectosilicate mineral which forms igneous rock.The name is from the Greek for straight fracture, because its two cleavage planes are at right angles to each other. It is a type of potassium feldspar, also known as K-feldspar.The gem known as moonstone (see below) is largely composed of orthoclase.he name is from the Greek for straight fracture, because its two cleavage planes are at right angles to each other.

8840901	The Mineral orthoclase. Orthoclase is one of the most common minerals, and occurs in numerous mineral environment s. It is polymorphous with the minerals Microcline and Sanidine. These three minerals form the Potassium Feldspar group.They are almost identical in physical properties, and it is sometimes impossible to distinguish one another without x-ray analysis. The only difference between them is their crystal structure.rthoclase is one of the most common minerals, and is found worldwide. Only a select few localities are mentioned. The original Carlsbad twins were described from Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), Bohemia, Czech Republic. Some of the best crystals come from Baveno, Piedmont, Italy, especially the famous Baveno twins.
8840902	In some mineral reference guides, Microcline and Sanidine are wrongly categorized as variety of Orthoclase. Since it is so difficult to distinguish between Orthoclase, Sanidine, and Microcline, they may be simply called  Potassium Feldspar .rthoclase is one of the most common minerals, and is found worldwide.

8840904	Best Breakfast Foods. You may have noticed a heart-shaped seal on your box of oatmeal recently. The seal's there because oats contain beta-glucan, a type of fiber that's been shown to help lower cholesterol when eaten regularly.
8840905	Types of Sausage. Sausage has been made for thousands of years, originally as a delicious means of preserving meat. Before refrigeration, salts and cures were added to meat to prevent it from spoiling. As time passed, new spices were added, as well as better sausage making techniques, that improved the quality and taste of sausage.
8840906	More From Power Rank. Anyone who doesnât love breakfast, claims to be too busy to eat it, or just grabs a Luna Bar on the way out the door should be banished to a remote island made of sausage. And no breakfast is complete without a large amount of delicious meat on your plate. Oh, those sweet, sweet breakfast meats!
8840907	Everyoneâs heard the word mutton, but many people have no idea what the heck it actually is. Basically, itâs just an older version of lamb, and itâs typically served as a breakfast dish in England. That whole country is like a retirement home for weird breakfast foods.
8840908	Types of fresh sausage include breakfast sausage, Polish sausage, Italian Sausage, and bratwurst. Cures sausage, like fresh sausage, cured sausage is also made from ground meat and spices, but cured sausage undergoes a curing process to prolong the shelf-life of the meat. For centuries, people have been curing meat by adding salts, drying meat, or fermenting meat.
8840909	You want to aim for a breakfast that combines good carbs and fiber with some protein, says Erica Giovinazzo, MS, RD, a nutritionist at Clay Health Club and Spa, in New York City. Luckily, your options are plenty. Here's a look at some of our favorite breakfast foods, along with expert tips for making them even healthier.
8840910	There's nothing like a banana at breakfast to keep those mid-morning cravings at bay. The yellow fruitâespecially when they're still a touch greenâare one of the best sources of resistant starch, a healthy carbohydrate that keeps you feeling fuller longer.
8840911	A cough can be non-productive (dry) or productive (when sputum is coughed up). It may occur only at night (then called nocturnal cough), during both night and day, or just during the day.
8840912	Sinus problems and postnasal drip also are causes of chronic cough with mucus. This condition can be difficult to detect. Sometimes CT scan of the sinuses is necessary for diagnosis.
8840913	A cough can be the result of a respiratory tract infection such as the common cold, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, pertussis, or tuberculosis. In the vast majority of cases, acute coughs, i.e. coughs shorter than 3 weeks, are due to the common cold. In people with a normal chest X-ray, tuberculosis is a rare finding. Pertussis is increasingly being recognised as a cause of troublesome coughing in adults. After a respiratory tract infection has cleared, the person may be left with a postinfectious cough. This typically is a dry, non-productive cough that produces no phlegm. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, and a tickle in the throat. This cough may often persist for weeks after an illness. The cause of the cough may be inflammation similar to that observed in repetitive stress disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
8840914	Less common causes of chronic cough include allergies, tumors, sarcoidosis, congestive heart failure, or other lung diseases such as chronic obstructive disease or emphysema. Lung diseases also can cause coughing up blood.
8840915	If your added cost of meals and lodging for that period don't exceed what you saved in airfare, those costs (the hotel bill plus 50 percent of meals) can be deducted as business expenses. Hopefully this literature above gives you some more clarity on what is deductible for business purposes.
8840916	You can put in up to 20 percent of your net earnings from self-employment, which is your net Schedule C profit minus the deduction for one-half of your self-employment tax. The maximum annual contribution for 2011 and 2012 is $49,000, and 50,000, respectively.
8840917	Another deduction often missed is depreciation if you own your car or lease payments if you lease. You can choose to deduct per mile driven or you can also do the actual cost of insurance, gas prices, repairs & maintenance, and other vehicle expenses.

To no surprise, framed glass shower doors cost less than their frameless counterparts. According to our estimator, you can save between $200 and $500 on your total project. Frameless shower doors are more expensive because the glass is thicker and they require special hardware.
8841107	Not just any loud sound will shatter a glass. It has to be the right resonant frequency. A human voice can shatter a glass. Every object has a resonant frequency â the natural frequency at which something vibrates. Wine glasses, because of their hollow shape, are particularly resonant. If you run a damp finger along the rim of a glass, you might hear a faint, ghostly hum â the resonant frequency of the glass.
8841108	The OP is referring to raw voice where glass shatters around them kind of thing. Not necessarily; in the ad, the singer's original, natural, unaided voice shattered glass...and only then did a recording of the sound also shatter glass. It was a claim of tonal fidelity in reproduction, not of volume.
8841109	Not denying that there may be something about lead crystal wine glasses that makes them more suscepible to shattering, but I have to point out that it is quite easy to get a resonant note with a moistened finger from the cheapest wine glasses money can buy in Woolworths.
8841110	The tone and pitch of the singer's voice are only two of the factors that contribute to how and when the glass breaks. The way the glass was made and the thickness of the glass also have a lot to do with it! So, a deep tone could break certain type of glass, while a squeaky high-pitched tone would break another type.
8841111	My late mother was trained as an opera singer. To my knowledge, she never shattered glass, but sometimes she would as a parlor trick fill several lead crystal wine glasses with water to various levels, line them up on a table, and then do her vocal exercises.
8841112	Experts believe a singer has to be both very good and very lucky to break a glass with the voice alone. But it can be doneâ¦. For example, very fine, leaded crystal glasses are more fragile than others. Thus, it may be easier to break such a glass than a thick water glass. Volume is another key factor.
8841113	I've searched and searched but can't find a thread on it, so forgive me if its been discussed. I used to hear about opera singers who can shatter glass with their voice, but can't seem to find much info about if that is real or not.
8841114	Opera singers have been rumoured to break glass with just their singing note. They have been trained to produce more than 100 db of volume and would have good pitch to match the resonance of the glass. More recently, rock singer Jamie Vendera has been filmed successfully breaking a wine glass using just his voice.
8841115	In 2005, the Discovery Channel television show MythBusters proved that a voice alone could break glass. Rock singer Jamie Vendera shattered a wine glass with a 105-decibel wail. By comparison, normal speech is usually around 50 decibels.
8841116	There are LOTS of factors that come into play when trying to break a glass with your voice! The pitch of your voice has to match the resonant frequency (the speed at which it will vibrate if struck) of the glass. The resonant frequency of the glass depends on the type of glass it is and how it was made.

Having The Winds of Winter published before season 6 of Thrones airs next spring âhas been important to me all along,â says the best-selling New Mexico author. âI wish it was out now. Maybe Iâm being overly optimistic about how quickly I can finish.
8841120	Looking back, Martin says his one regret is not plowing ahead into Winds after finishing 2011âs A Dance with Dragons. âI was red hot on the book and I put it aside for six monthsâ he says. âI was so into it. I was pushing so hard that I was writing very well.

Iâm still weighing whether to go that direction or not. Itâs a great twist.
8841124	Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water on Earth and other planets, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.

Hydrometeorology is the study of the transfer of water and energy between land and water body surfaces and the lower atmosphere.
8841127	Domains of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface hydrology, hydrogeology, drainage basin management and water quality, where water plays the central role. Oceanography and meteorology are not included because water is only one of many important aspects within those fields.
8841128	Observations of hydrologic processes are used to make predictions of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist. Statistical hydrology
8841129	It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified. Pioneers of the modern science of hydrology include Pierre Perrault, Edme Mariotte and Edmund Halley. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the Seine.

8841133	Why Is My Dog Sneezing Repeatedly? At one point or another, we have all probably asked the question, why does my dog keep sneezing? Dogs sneeze in order to get rid of infectious organisms such as bacteria and viruses. They also sneeze to expel foreign bodies that have found their way up their nostrils. Dog sneezing is a symptom, not an illness by itself.
8841134	Nasal mites and dog sneezing. Your dog might sneeze because of an irritant every once in a while. Parasites â namely, nasal mites â can cause repetitive or chronic sneezing in dogs. At only about a millimeter in length, these mites can be difficult to spot in and around your dogâs nose when they first establish themselves.
8841135	Snorting, by contrast, looks like and is defined almost identically as a sneeze. The difference is that a sneeze is involuntary, while a snort is a voluntary effort on the part of the snorter. Dogs and cats sneeze and snort for all sorts of reasons related to the workings of the upper respiratory tract. Though many of them are normal and benign responses to simple irritation, some can signal infections, upper airway obstructions and allergic disease, among other conditions of the upper respiratory tract.
8841136	Reverse sneezing: While sneezing and snorting are both expulsions of air from the nose/mouth, âreverseâ sneezing is an involuntary, spastic inhalation that some dogs experience. Episodes can last a few minutes at a time. It is not uncommon for a dog to do this after being walked and snuffling something (dust, pollen, dirt) into his nose.
8841137	Breed characteristics (dogs with short snout such as pugs, bulldogs, Pekingese, etc. are more likely to sneeze due to infection or irritating products). Find Out the Causes of Dog Sneezing. Here are some questions that may be helpful in pinpointing the possible cause that brings about sneezing in your dog:
8841138	Other Dog Sneezing Natural Remedies Ointments of Calendula or Aloe: If your dog's nose becomes red and irritating because of the nasal discharges resulting from sneezing, apply an ointment of either calendula or aloe to the affected area(s).
8841139	Rhinitis and sinusitis and dog sneezing. Rhinitis and sinusitis are conditions in which the nose itself or the interior nasal passages, respectively, become inflamed. Dogs might sneeze as a result of inflammation, but dog owners will notice more dramatic changes in these cases.
8841140	Dogs and cats both are susceptible to allergies that affect the nasal passages as well as to nasal inflammation for a variety of other immune system-related processes. 4. Inhaled irritants. Dust, perfumes, carpet powders, pollen and other common inhaled irritants can cause sneezing in dogs and cats. Snorting: 1. Upper airway obstruction.
8841141	Tumors and dog sneezing. Malignant growths such as carcinomas or sarcomas can develop in and around a dogâs nasal area with age. They tend to afflict very old dogs â over the age of 10 â and some larger dog breeds as they approach seniority. Sneezing is one symptom of a canine nasal tumor in an older dog, but watch out for labored breathing, discolored fluids (like pus and blood) dripping from a dogâs nose or distended skin around the nose and face. Is your dog sneezing a lot? See a vet! An ordinary dog sneeze is an ephemeral, even amusing phenomenon.
8841142	Just as a wet or dry nose is not a reliable indicator of a dogâs general health, neither is sneezing a reliable sign of dog allergies. For illness, we look to a dogâs activity level and eating habits as symptoms. For allergies, dogs are much more likely to develop discolored and itchy patches on their skin.

8841152	This is the reason why the summer monsoon forms the rainy season in many tropical areas. In the late fall and early winter, the situation is reversed. Land surfaces cool off quickly in response to cooler weather, but the same property of water that makes it slow to absorb heat also causes it to cool slowly.
8841153	General monsoon circulation. Monsoons, like most other winds, occur in response to the Sun heating the atmosphere. In their simplest form, monsoons are caused by differences in temperatures between the oceans and continents. They are most likely to form where a large continental landmass meets a major ocean basin.
8841154	June 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in India, as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of Kerala. The monsoon accounts for 80% of the rainfall in India. [citation needed] Indian agriculture (which accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs 70% of the population) is heavily dependent on the rains, for growing crops especially like cotton, rice, oilseeds and coarse grains.
8841155	Monsoons are often associated with rainy seasons in the tropics (the areas of Earth within 23.5 degrees latitude of the equator) and the subtropics (areas between 23.5 and about 35 degrees latitude, both north and south). In these areas, life is critically dependent on the monsoon rains. A weak monsoon rainy season may cause drought, crop failures, and hardship for people and wildlife. However, heavy monsoon rains have caused massive floods that have killed thousands of people. Many parts of the world experience monsoons to some extent. Probably the most famous are the Asian monsoons, which affect India, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Monsoons also impact portions of central Africa, where their rain is critical to supporting life in the area south of the Sahara Desert.
8841156	Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought. Similar rainfall is caused when moist ocean air is lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface.
8841157	This is why summer monsoons cause so much rain over land. In the colder months, the cycle is reversed. Then the land cools faster than the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the ocean. This causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean.
8841158	During the weak LC, there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon, because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian through flow.

From 1857, the cent was 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel, giving the coin a whitish appearance.
8841295	Best Answer: The first year for the 95% copper cent was 1864. The only year between 1864 and 1982 where it wasn't copper was 1943, when it was made out of steel (the copper was considered a vital war material).

8841398	To find the semi-perimeter of the triangle, all you have to do is add up all of the sides and divide the result by two. The formula for finding the semi-perimeter of a triangle is the following: semi-perimeter = (length of side a + length of side b + length of side c) / 2, or s = (a + b + c) / 2.
8841399	Right triangle is a triangle whose one of the angle is right angle. Also the sum of other two angles is equal to 90 degrees. Right Triangle Formula is used to calculate the area, perimeter, unknown sides and unknown angles of the right triangle. Right Triangle Formula is given below as, The unknown sides in a right triangle can be calculated using the Pythagoras formula. The unknown angles in a right triangle can be calculated using the sine, cosine and tangent formulas.
8841400	Though the most common way to find the area of a triangle is to multiply the base and height and to divide the result by two, there are a number of other ways to find the area of a triangle depending on what dimensions you are given.
8841401	Plug the appropriate values into the formula for finding the area of a triangle. The formula for finding the area of a triangle is called Heron's formula and is the following: Area = â{s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}. Remember from the previous step that s is the semi-perimeter and a, b, and c are the triangleâs three sides.
8841402	In the triangles in Examples 1 and 3, the lateral sides are not perpendicular to the base, so a dotted line is drawn to represent the height. Find the area of an acute triangle with a base of 15 inches and a height of 4 inches.
8841403	A triangle is a three-sided polygon. We will look at several types of triangles in this lesson. To find the area of a triangle, multiply the base by the height, and then divide by 2. The division by 2 comes from the fact that a parallelogram can be divided into 2 triangles. For example, in the diagram to the left, the area of each triangle is equal to one-half the area of the parallelogram.
8841404	There are other formulas for finding the area of a triangle depending on whether you know the length of the three sides, the length of one side of an equilateral triangle, or the length of two sides and their included angle.
8841405	Also the sum of other two angles is equal to 90 degrees. Right Triangle Formula is used to calculate the area, perimeter, unknown sides and unknown angles of the right triangle. The unknown sides in a right triangle can be calculated using the Pythagoras formula.

8841412	Best Answer: Citing Sources Orally. â¢ In the speech, you should provide an âoral citationâ in which you make it clear to your audience what the source for that particular fact, quote, statistic, etc. is, and why that source is credible.
8841413	Tips for Oral Citations. We generally expect presentations to include oral citations of sources. This expectation is reflected in the âmaterialâ trait in the rubric. (If you require a written outline, citations should be included in the outline.
8841414	(Note: Since newspaper provide information that is time-sensitive, it is often important to include the date of the article in your oral citation. If the newspaper is a credible one, and the article is not an editorial, you usually donât have to include the name of the author in the oral citation. However, you should almost always include the name of the newspaper in the oral citation and the name of the person quoted.) Television Program:

8841417	Cumulonimbus clouds often form thunderstorms. Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning.
8841418	The sound is more muted. Then other shock waves from more distance locations arrive to the listener. Shock waves from different locations along the lightning bolt can arrive at the same time to the listener's ear enhancing the volume. At large distances from the center, the shock wave (thunder) can be many miles across.
8841419	The Sound of Thunder. Regardless of whether lightning is positive or negative, thunder is produced the same way. Thunder is the acoustic shock wave resulting from the extreme heat generated by a lightning flash. Lightning can be as hot as 54,000Â°F (30,000Â°C), a temperature that is five times hotter than surface of the sun!

It is essentially set based and has as its fundamental unit the 'table', which is composed of a set of one or more 'columns', each of which contains a data element.
8841469	But it is also true that most of these parties rarely win elections or have much of an impact on political races. For most of our history, we have had, for all intents and purposes, a two-party systemâa political process dominated by just two political parties.Scholars attribute this fact to several reasons. Some emphasize certain structural features of our political system.ut while these structural features of our system hinder minor parties, the greatest reason for the persistence of a two-party system is the ideological consensus in the United States. Americans may disagree on policy details, but the vast majority agree on fundamental principles.

8841473	1 American politics has always been dominated by two parties. 2  Structural factors in the political system (especially single-member district voting) favor a two-party (rather than multiparty) system.ut while these structural features of our system hinder minor parties, the greatest reason for the persistence of a two-party system is the ideological consensus in the United States. Americans may disagree on policy details, but the vast majority agree on fundamental principles.
8841474	With regard to the global warming controversy, the scientific mainstream puts neither doubt on the existence of global warming nor on its causes and effects. The politicization of science in the sense of a manipulation of science for political gains is a part of the political process.It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. Politicization of climate science-Although there is a consensus on the science of global warming and its likely effects-some special interests groups work to suppress the consensus while others work to amplify the alarm of global warming.
8841475	Yet many political scientists, like most mainstream journalists and political reformers, refuse to even acknowledge or take seriously the case for asymmetric polarization. It makes us uncomfortable because some people will characterize the idea as partisan, even if it accurately captures reality.he widespread public belief that our political system is dangerously broken is often met with skepticism among longtime students of American politics. âWeâve seen it all before,â âthis too will pass,â ânothing can do done about it anywayâ say the scholars.

8841519	Senator Warren, for instance, argued that if the federal minimum wage had increased with workersâ productivity since the 1970s, it would now stand at $22.00 an hour, instead of $7.25.[10] People come to this conclusion by comparing productivity and pay data improperly.
8841520	The ProductivityâPay Gap. 1  Updated August 2016. 2  Most Americans believe that a rising tide should lift all boatsâthat as the economy expands, everybody should reap the rewards. And for two-and-a-half decades beginning in the late 1940s, this was how our economy worked.
8841521	Over this period, the pay (wages and benefits) of typical workers rose in tandem with productivity (how much workers produce per hour). In other words, as the economy became more efficient and expanded, everyday Americans benefitted correspondingly through better pay. But in the 1970s, this started to change.
8841522	Productivity describes what an employer receives in exchange for wages or salary paid to an employee. Productivity is closely related to profits earned for a company, but productivity need not be a monetary measurement. As an example, productivity of sales representatives might be related to number of cold calls made, rather than a monetary return on investment. Productivity is rarely an easy measurement.
8841523	Figure B provides more detail on the productivity-pay disparity from 1973 to 2011 by charting the accumulated growth since 1973 in productivity; real average hourly compensation; and real median hourly compensation of all workers, and of men and of women.
8841524	Productivity Based Pay Law and Legal Definition. Productivity-based pay rewards employees based on measurements of the quantity of work and outputs. Two types of productivity-based pay systems are gain sharing and profit sharing arrangements. These arrangements can be complicated and require the existence of sophisticated procedures for calculating bonuses.
8841525	Growth of hourly productivity, real average hourly compensation, and real median hourly compensation (overall and by gender), 1973â2011. Note: Compensation is for production/nonsupervisory workers in the private sector, and productivity is for the total economy.
8841526	Productivity and Compensation: Growing Together. As research fellow in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, James Sherk researches ways to promote competition and mobility. President John F. Kennedy believed that âa rising tide lifts all boats,â but many question if that remains true today.
8841527	A key to understanding this growth of income inequalityâand the disappointing increases in workersâ wages and compensation and middle-class incomesâis understanding the divergence of pay and productivity.
8841528	The laminate flooring will probably need to be cut lengthwise for the last row. Line up the flooring pieces on top of the last row of installed planks. Use a plank and a spacer to trace the contour of the wall onto the board that will be cut. Read on to discover how to finish up your laminate flooring installation.
8841529	The following install instructions focus on the most popular type of laminate flooring -- board-style planks with tongue-and-groove construction. Start on the left side of the room and work to the right. Place spacers along each wall to set up the expansion zone.
8841530	Consider your dimensions â a floating floor should not run more than 40ft long or 20ft wide, and must be broken up at these dimensions. Pay attention to the floorâs wood grain, pattern or design; this makes a difference in the way the flooring will affect your roomâs design.
8841531	Set the first plank down, and add another piece of the flooring to the right, lining up the short ends and locking them into place. When you get to the end of the first row and you need to cut the last piece, measure the distance between the last piece and the wall. Subtract a quarter-inch (6 mm) before cutting.
8841532	If you are making your laminate flooring a DIY project, you might wonder âwhat is the right direction to install my laminate flooring?â When deciding the direction to install laminate flooring, I always let people know they have multiple options, but in the end, it is all about your personal taste and preference.
8841533	Follow these guidelines and you should be able to decide the appropriate direction. Just remember to visualize and take into consideration all aspects of your laminate flooring and installation room. More Installation Tips: 9 Essential Tips for Laminate Floor Installation.
8841534	Laminate Flooring - which way to lay? There are lots of âHow to Lay Laminate Flooringâ articles on the internet, but while these step-by-step guides are a good way to get acquainted with the basics, they have a tendency to leave things out. An amateur DIY-er can run into any number of unexpected dilemmas when laying laminate flooring, many of which are glossed over by the how-to guides.
8841535	The instructions for the last type of laminate flooring I installed actually recommended not selecting the direction based on the longer dimenension of the room, but based on how much light is coming in from each wall, and to select it so the planks ran perpendicular to the wall with the most light.

8841540	Lewis structures (also known as Lewis dot diagrams, Lewis dot formulas, Lewis dot structures, and electron dot structures) are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule.[1][2][3] A Lewis structure can be drawn for any covalently bonded molecule, as well as coordination ...
8841541	The Lewis structure was named after Gilbert N. Lewis, who introduced it in his 1916 article The Atom and the Molecule. Lewis structures extend the concept of the electron dot diagram by adding lines between atoms to represent shared pairs in a chemical bond. Lewis structures show each atom and its position in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol.
8841542	Lewis structures, also known as Lewis dot diagrams, Lewis dot formulas, Lewis dot structures, electron dot structures, or Lewis electron dot structures (LEDS), are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule.
8841543	Use the following periodic table to answer the next questions: Find the number of valence electrons in the following elements. a) Oxygen. b) Radon. c) Boron. What element is represented by the following Lewis Dot Diagram? Draw the Lewis Dot Diagram's for the following elements: a) Strontium. b) Nitrogen. c) Neon. An element has 7 valence electrons.
8841544	Lewis structure. Lewis structures (also known as Lewis dot diagrams, Lewis dot formulas, Lewis dot structures, and electron dot structures) are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule.
8841545	A Lewis Diagram serves to represent the number of valence electrons that an element has. Every dot represents a valence electron. Valence electrons are the electrons in the last layer of an atom. For example, the element Lithium has 1 valence electron. The number of valence electrons increases from left to right in the periodic table. The elements in the last period (row) (example: Xenon) have a full last layer, which means eight valence electrons. Usually, transition metals such as platinum have 3 valence electrons. However, there are some exceptions. Platinum has only 1 valence electron as the diagram shows below. Don't forget to put the atomic symbol (Pt) in this case in the middle. Platinum is not the only element that has only one valence electron (there is sodium, potassium and a few others), so you need to differentiate.
8841546	After the release of egg, the levels of FSH decrease while those of estrogen increase. Depending upon the occurrence of fertilization, the body either prepares for a pregnancy or a period. However, this is the scenario only when one is experiencing regular menstrual cycle or while one is in their fertility age.
8841547	FSH and LH levels in perimenopause are often found to be high in comparison with levels of these hormones in menstruating women. However, they are not as high as in those women who have already reached a menopause.
8841548	1 Premenopause: There is no change in cycle length and a woman can predict when she will get her period. 2  Early Transition: There is a decrease in predictability regarding when a woman will get her period because her cycle sare no longer the same length each month.
8841549	A follicle-stimulating hormone test measures the amount of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in a blood sample. FSH is produced by the pituitary gland. 1  In women, FSH helps control the menstrual cycle and the production of eggs by the ovaries. 2  In men, FSH helps control the production of sperm.
8841550	Significance of FSH Levels. FSH or follicle-stimulating hormone is an important hormone of endocrine system. It is released by the pituitary gland and plays a vital role in women's menstrual cycle. Every month, FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce a mature follicle or egg. Hence, their levels are usually high when the body begins to prepare for a menstrual cycle.
8841551	1 In women, FSH helps control the menstrual cycle and the production of eggs by the ovaries. 2  The amount of FSH varies throughout a woman's menstrual cycle and is highest just before she releases an egg (ovulates). 3  In men, FSH helps control the production of sperm.
8841552	1 Early Transition: There is a decrease in predictability regarding when a woman will get her period because her cycle sare no longer the same length each month. 2  Some women may be able to predict their menstrual cycle for several months, but the length of their usual cycle has changed by several days.
8841553	The Menopause Transition. There are various stages in the menopause transition. Women proceed from being premenopausal to postmenopausal over several years. Some women go through the menopause earlier and/or more quickly than others just as some women have bothersome symptoms while others do not.
8841554	Menopause is a natural event that happens in every woman's life. The average age for menopause in the United States is approximately 52 years, but the menopause transition can last for a number of years.
8841555	Normal FSH levels in women are in a range of 5 to 25 mIU/ml. If they are more than 25 but less than 50, one is said to be in a perimenopausal phase. Menopausal women have FSH levels over 50 mIU/ml. Thus, the levels of FSH are highly indicative of how far one is from the impending menopause.
8841556	What it got instead was Newcastle, who went through three managers -- first Kevin Keegan; then Chris Hughton; then Joe Kinnear; then Hughton, briefly, again -- before finally apologising their way out of the league under the guidance of Alan Shearer.
8841557	At the inception of the Premier League in 1992/93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches were 'foreign' (players hailing from outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland).
8841558	There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions.
8841559	Form Before Villa's home game with West Brom they had suffered seven Premier League defeats in a row and Tim Sherwood is still searching for his first point. Key player Christian Benteke has struggled like every Villa player this season but a return to form is sorely required in the final weeks.
8841560	In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League to take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal and on May 27, 1992, the Premier League as we know it today was formed.
8841561	Form Everton still have fewer wins against Premier League opposition in 2015 than Bradford City. It is an appalling and increasingly worrying statistic as Roberto Martinez continues to talk a great game but the results do not back up his positivity.
8841562	Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception. This group is composed of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.
8841563	SUNDERLAND. Form Sunderland are a hard team to beat, but they draw far too many of them. Sunderland have won just two league games at home since October and just one in 2015, which is why they are in relegation trouble. They have kept the scoreboard ticking over with draws, but itâs not enough.
8841564	David James holds the record for the most Premier League appearances, overtaking the previous record held by Gary Speed of 535 appearances in February 2009. The first ever Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2â1 win against Manchester United.
8841565	Down at the bottom of the Premier League, things are getting tense. Six points is all that separates Cardiff City in 20th from Hull City in 10th.

8841635	In practice, the president does. Legal scholars continue to debate the fine points of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, but as Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith recently pointed out, âconstitutional practiceâ carries far more legal weight than theoretical debate.

Going close to that speed through air can cause some unusual visual effects. This compiled footage includes F-14s, standard and Blue Angels F-18s, plus the SR-71 and an Atlas Rocket launch. AVweb contacted sources at NASA to research the phenomena.
8841662	Fighter jets use the afterburner to fly faster than the speed of sound for long periods, but it decreases the range they can fly without refueling. The F/A-22 is the first American fighter aircraft with the ability to supercruise, or fly at supersonic speeds without using the afterburner. In early flight tests, it sustained speeds of Mach 1.5 -- that's one and a half times the speed of sound -- without using the afterburner.
8841663	In water at room temperature supersonic speed can be considered as any speed greater than 1,440 m/s (4,724 ft/s).
8841664	That means the Raptor can fly faster for longer periods of time, reaching far-off targets faster than other jets. It can stay in an area looking for enemy targets longer or carry a bigger bomb load because it does not have to carry as much fuel.
8841665	Supersonic speed is a rate of travel of an object that exceeds the speed of sound (Mach 1). For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20 Â°C (68 Â°F) at sea level, this speed is approximately 343.2 m/s, 1,125 ft/s, 768 mph, 667 knots, or 1,235 km/h. Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5) are often referred to as hypersonic.

8841762	The chemistry definition of oxidation is the loss of electrons. Na atoms react by losing an electron, so they are being oxidized. 1 person found this useful.
8841763	Mg gets oxidised because it has lost 2 electrons and Cl gets reduced because it has gained an electron. An oxidising agent is the one which is deficit of electrons and can accept electrons from other elements(i.e it can make other elements get oxidised).
8841764	Answers. Best Answer: Look at the oxidation numbers Mg is 0 because it's an element not reacted with anything else Cl2 is 0 for the same reason. Mg+2 is +2 because the overall oxidation number of an ion is it's charge Cl-is -1 (I'm going to assume you forgot to include the-on the Cl).
8841765	Oxidation = losing electrons is oxidation. Reduction = gaining electrons is reduction The Mg is giving up 2 electrons so it's being oxidized The Cl are both gaining an electron so they are being reduced. Source(s): Ricki Â· 2 years ago.
8841766	oxidation-reduction reactions-oxidation states change. 1  oxidation-increasing oxidation number, losing electrons. 2  reduction-decreasing oxidation number, gaining electrons. 3  reduction always accompanies oxidation (and vice versa). 4  oxidizing agent (oxidant) - makes it possible for another substance to get oxidized.
8841767	â¦ say that glucose (or whatever substance is being metabolized) is oxidized, using O2 as the oxidizing agent to form C02, which is released.
8841768	Reduction is the gain of electrons. The oxidizing agent is reduced. The reducing agent is oxidized. Cu goes from 0 to +2, it lost electrons. S went from +6 to +4, it gained electrons. I went from 0 to +5, it lost electrons. N went from +5 to +4, it gained electrons.
8841769	Best Answer: Cu(s) substance gets oxidized. 2AgNO3 (aq) substance gets reduced. 2AgNO3 (aq) is the oxidizing agent. Cu(s) is the reducing agent.
8841770	For the following equations, determine the oxidizing agent and reducing agent. 1  remember, oxidizing agent gets reduced, reducing agent gets oxidized. 2  oxidizing agent. 3  reducing agent. 4  reducing agent.

8841775	Since the finale of season one, Once Upon A Time has had a scary decline in ratings with each episode, with the rare jewel propping them up a tick or two during the season. Season five was no different. It faltered big time, just as the seasons before it, when it came to bringing in big numbers for its parent network.
8841776	Depending on the snake they usually are hidden in grasses or small tight spaces like under parts of rocks and some even live in trees.
8841777	How do you attract a lost pet snake out of hiding? If the snake isn't coming out that likely means it is both full and comfortable. Start by dropping the temperature in the room it is in several degrees while simultaneously puâ¦tting a warm spot out that will attract its attention.
8841778	Great Basin Rattlesnake. The Great Basin Rattlesnake is light brown or gray with a tapering row of brownish blotches down the midline of the back. Scales are large and keeled (not flat and smooth) in 25-27 rows. Their range is from southeast Oregon, southern Idaho, and northeast California, to Nevada, western Utah, and northwest Arizona.
8841779	Rattlesnakes are not confined to rural areas. They have been found in urban areas, on riverbanks and lakeside parks and at golf courses. The following safety precautions can be taken to reduce the likelihood of an encounter with a rattlesnake. 1  Be alert. 2  Wear sturdy boots and loose-fitting long pants. 3  Children should not wear flip-flops while playing outdoors in snake country.  When hiking, stick to well-used 1  trails. Do not step or put your hands where you cannot  see.

8841781	What you should NOT do after a rattlesnake bite. 1  DONâT apply a tourniquet. 2  DONâT pack the bite area in ice. 3  DONâT cut the wound with a knife or razor.  DONâT use your mouth to suck out the 1  venom. DONâT let the victim drink alcohol.
8841782	What should I do if I encounter a rattlesnake? Leave it alone. Most bites occur when individuals or dogs provoke the rattlesnake or if you try to capture or kill it. Rattlesnakes only bite or attack in self-defense, so the best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the rattlesnake alone.
8841783	Keep any vegetation from growing up or over the fence as snakes can use it as a way over the fence. Check under your house and around the perimeter to close any gaps or holes where a rattlesnake could hide. Fill in or block any holes or gaps were a snake can hide or slip through the fence or under your house.
8841784	Rattlesnakes hibernate through the winter in communal burrows. For the Great Basin Rattlesnakes, mating occurs between March and May and sometimes in the fall. Young are live-born, usually between August and October in litter sizes of 4 - 21 young. The record lifespan of a Great Basin Rattlesnake is 19 Â½ years.
8841785	Here are some additional tips on how to protect your pets from rattlesnakes. 1  Always keep your dog or pet on a leash when outside of your home or away from your yard. 2  Don't let your dog wander into tall grass or thick shrubs where rattlesnakes may be hiding.

8841798	Ron Chepesiuk, author of Superfly: The True, Untold Story of Frank Lucas, American Gangster, said the idea that Lucas turned in only corrupt cops is an effort by Tinsel Town to soften Lucas' image as a snitch. Deep down, nobody really likes or respects a snitch; he was not a snitch out of any altruistic motive.
8841799	Yes. According to the American Gangster true story, it was Frank's wife, Julie Lucas, who bought him the fur coat, which he at first thought was her new coat (BET, American Gangster). Frank is convinced that the chinchilla coat was what led the police to take note of him.
8841800	Following the death of his employer and mentor, Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas establishes himself as the number one importer of heroin in the Harlem district of Manhattan. He does so by buying heroin directly from the source in South East Asia and he comes up with a unique way of importing the drugs into the United States.

8841806	The cumulative fraction function and the empirical distribution function are two names for the same thing: a graphical display of how the data is distributed. Consider the dataset B1: B1={1.26, 0.34, 0.70, 1.75, 50.57, 1.55, 0.08, 0.42, 0.50, 3.20, 0.15, 0.49, 0.95, 0.24, 1.37, 0.17, 6.98, 0.10, 0.94, 0.38}.
8841807	Data can be distributed (spread out) in different ways. But there are many cases where the data tends to be around a central value with no bias left or right, and it gets close to a Normal Distribution like this: A Normal Distribution. The Bell Curve is a Normal Distribution. And the yellow histogram shows some data that.
8841808	Note that there really isn't a standard meaning for the size of an error bar. Common choices are: 1 (the range would include about 68% of normal data), 2 which is basically the same as 95% limits, and 0.674Ã which would include 50% of normal data. The above may be a population standard deviation or a standard deviation of the mean.
8841809	There are two ways that the normal curve may be represented: The actual normal curve and the standard normal curve. The curve represents the distribution of actual data. The actual data points (xi) are represented on the abscissa (x-scale) and the number of occurrences are indicated on the ordinate (y-scale).
8841810	The variance is the mean squared deviation from the average in a set of data. It is used to determine the standard deviation, which is an indicator of the spread or dispersion of a data set. 3.3 Standard deviation. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
8841811	With discrete data, the entire distribution can either be developed from scratch or the data can be fitted to a pre-specified discrete distribution. With the former, there are two steps to building the distribution.
8841812	For an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle points. 2.3 Mode. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently. The data 2.6, 2.2, 2.4, 2.3, 2.5 do not contain a mode because no value occurs more than any other.
8841813	A normal distribution is symmetric about the mean. Skew is a measure of how much the bell-curve for your data set is heavy on one side. A normal distribution also has a specific width for a given height. If you double the height, the width scales proportionally. However, you could imagine stretching a bell curve out in weird ways without changing its symmetry.
8841814	If several shells are used at a time, at least one of them is likely to be oriented correctly. Pattern shells were first used in the early 1990s in Washington D.C. to greet Desert Storm troops upon their arrival home. The patterns that were used there were purple hearts and yellow bows, Heckman said.
8841815	1 First, so that fireworks go where you intend to and don't fly in a random direction, causing fires, property damage, or injuries. 2  Second, because it helps display organizers to position firework effects with accuracy and precision.
8841816	When metal salts are ignited, they release energy in the form of light. Shorter wavelengths of light (400 to 500 nanometers) produce violet and blue colors while longer wavelengths of light (600 to 700 nanometers) produce orange and red colors.
8841817	That's chemistry too! Fireworks get their color from metal compounds (also known as metal salts) packed inside. You probably know that if you burn metals in a hot flame (such as a Bunsen burner in a school laboratory), they glow with very intense colorsâ that's exactly what's happening in fireworks.
8841818	When metal salts emit short wavelengths of visible light in the range of 400 to 500 nanometers, they produce violet and blue colors. When metal salts emit longer wavelengths of visible light in the range of 600 to 700 nanometers, they produce orange and red colors.
8841819	Thousands of people across the United States will be celebrating Independence Day on July 4 by attending a fireworks display. The red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple colors exploding in the night sky during a fireworks display are created by the use of metal salts. Photo credit: Jeff Golden. In chemistry, a salt is defined as an ionic compound that is formed from the reaction of an acid and a base.
8841820	The recipe that creates blue, for example, includes varying amounts of copper chloride compounds, while red comes from strontium and lithium salts. Just like paints, secondary colors are made by mixing the ingredients of their primary-color relatives. A mixture of copper (blue) and strontium (red) makes purple.
8841821	On Independence Days of yore, old-timey crowds were dazzled by a mere sprinkle or two of off-white lights. Later generations oohed-and-aahed at more colorful displays, as chemical combos were developed that could light up the sky in Technicolor. The march of progress in pyrotechnics didn't stop there, though.
8841822	View full size image. Behind the scenes of the dazzling light shows that spectators ooh and ahh at on the Fourth of July, are carefully crafted fireworks. Whether red, white and blue fountains or purple sparklers, each firework is packed with just the right mix of chemicals to create these colorful lights. Inside each handmade firework are small packets filled with special chemicals, mainly metal salts and metal oxides, which react to produce an array of colors.
